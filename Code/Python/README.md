=================================

MAIN FILES:  
FeatureSelection.py - The latest code to perform feature selection. The code combines multiple feature selection algorithms from previous versions to generate different results that can be interpreted.  
PolynomialRegression.py - The latest code to build predictive model using Polynomial Regression. Histogram and Actual vs Predicted plots are used for visualisation.  
RandomForestRegression.py - The latest code to build predictive model using Tree-based algorithms such as Random Forest. Histogram and Actual vs Predicted plots are used for visualisation.  
SupportVectorMachine.py - The latest code to build predictive model using Support Vector Machine with different kernels. Histogram and Actual vs Predicted plots are used for visualisation.  
requirements.txt - Libraries and packages used in the code.

=================================

OLD VERSIONS:  
CorrelationMatrix.py - The code performs feature selection using Correlation Matrix. A heatmap is used for visualisation.  
TreeBasedFeatureImportance.py - The code performs feature selection using Tree-based algorithms such as Random Forest Regression. Bar chart is used for visualisation.  
RecursiveFeatureElimination.py - The code performs feature selection using Recursive Feature Elimination. Feature rankings are printed on console.  
UnivariateSelection.py - The code performs feature selection using Univariate Selection with Mutual Information test. Feature rankings and scores are printed on console.
